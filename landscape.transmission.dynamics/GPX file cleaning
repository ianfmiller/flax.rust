GPX file cleaning
Methods:
1) Open .gpx file in GPX editor
2) Zoom in all the way with 'Apple Standard' view
3) Trace path from beginning
4) Whenever an irregular pattern (apparent deviation from a normal path) occurs:
	a)Switch view to 'Apple Satelite' (this will zoom map out a bit)
	b)Check to see if deviation is real based on satellite imagery
	c)If it is real, delete points
5) Delete all waypoints backtracking from end of transect to start
6) Save file as x.cleaned.gpx
